    <center><p>The player who goes first may click which square they would like to occupie.
        That player is player 1, player 2 is the person who moves second.
        First player to occupie 3 squares connecting via diagonal, horizontal, or vertically is the winner.
    <center><p>The game is 2 player so you will need a friend for this game.
        Once you have a friend if you want to go first click the square you would like to occupie vice versa.
        After the first move has been made player 1s occupied squares will appear blue. Hence player 2s
        occupied squares will appear yellow.
